# Deepfake-Audi-Detection-Model
An AI-powered model for detecting deepfake audio from direct audio files and from video sources by extracting their audio track. The system converts the audio into Mel spectrograms and uses a Convolutional Neural Network for classification. Supports input from .wav files, local videos, and online video links (e.g., YouTube).
